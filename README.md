# VMAS Exchange Deployment
Automate the deployment of Exchange servers using PowerShell in VMAS.

Here are some of the features:
1.  Deploy one or more Exchange servers
2.  Deploy a new Exchange organization
3.  Create a DAG with one or more IP addresses or IP-less only

Note: For best results you should have the Exchange installation files downloaded prior to running. This is a requirement for Exchange 2019 on Server Core.

Example:
.\Deploy-ExchangeServer.ps1
